## Getting Started

To run the game, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Clone this repository or download the code files and save them in a directory.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/alexcamachogz/python_snake.git
```

## Running the Game

To start the game, run the `snake_game.py` file using Python. The game window will open, and you can use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.

## Game Rules

* The snake starts with a length of 1 segment.
* The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
* The objective is to eat the food that appears on the screen.
* Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, and the score increases.
* The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own tail.
* After the game ends, the final score is displayed on the screen.

## Code Structure

The code consists of the following files:

`main.py`: This is the main file that contains the game logic and controls.
`snake.py`: This file defines the Snake class, which represents the snake in the game.
`food.py`: This file defines the Food class, which represents the food that the snake needs to eat.
`scoreboard.py`: This file defines the Scoreboard class, which keeps track of the score and displays it on the screen.
